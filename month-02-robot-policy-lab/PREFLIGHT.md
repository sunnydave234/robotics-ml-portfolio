# Month 2 Preflight — robot-policy-lab

## W1D1 Findings

- Pinned commit: 2d7a42011a4f8e05a8c85d5fb908da258d4cc7b1
- Python: 3.12.12 (separate venv: ~/envs/robotics-policy-lab).
  Month 1 env (3.11.9) untouched.
- CLI: lerobot-train --policy.type=act --dataset.repo_id=<data> --policy.repo_id=<hub target>
  Both repo_ids required and distinct: dataset.repo_id = training data source,
  policy.repo_id = hub push target (required by cfg.validate() even if not pushing).
- Config system: Python dataclasses (ACTConfig), not Hydra YAML.
  Location: src/lerobot/policies/act/configuration_act.py
- ACTConfig defaults (line 85-86): chunk_size=100, n_action_steps=100
- Validation (__post_init__, line 138-146): n_action_steps must be 1 if temporal
  ensembling is enabled; n_action_steps must be <= chunk_size.
- MPS: auto-detected ("Device 'None' is not available. Switching to 'mps'") —
  did NOT silently fall back to CPU as expected. Training ran successfully,
  lo.595 -> 0.397 over 7.3K/100K steps, no MPS op errors.
- Throughput baseline (MPS, batch_size=8): ~202 samples/sec, ~25 steps/sec.
  Compare against Week 3 4xT4 DDP numbers.
- Missing extra: 'accelerate' not included by default — required `pip install -e ".[training]"`.
- Known warning (non-blocking): objc duplicate libavdevice symbol conflict between
  `av` package's bundled libavdevice.61 and Homebrew ffmpeg's libavdevice.62.
  Did not crash training; flagged as possible future instability source.
- Week 2 contract: RobotForgeAdapter.__getitem__ must return action[t : t+n_action_steps].

## W2D2 — Config system: draccus, not Hydra

- Confirmed: draccus ChoiceRegistry entries (`PreTrainedConfig._choice_registry`)
  are populated by decorator side-effect on import — `"act"` is NOT resolvable
  until `lerobot.policies.act.configuration_act` (or equivalent) has been
  imported somewhere in the process. lerobot-train's real entry point handles
  this via `register_third_party_plugins()`; our debug script does it with a
  direct import.
- Settings file format is JSON (`--config_path=x.json`), not YAML/Hydra.
  Precedence: file defaults < CLI flags, same order Hydra used.
- No Hydra multirun equivalent in draccus — sweeps need a manual bash loop.
